/**
 * Identifiers of common return periods, also referred to in PSHA as

 * <p>Each identifier is structured as follows, for example {@code PE2IN50}:
 *
 * <ul><li>Reads as a 2% Poisson probability of exceeding some measure of ground
 * motion in a 50 year period.</li>
 *
 * <li>Is equivalent to an annual rate of occurrence of ~0.000404 (see
 * {@link #annualRate()}).</li>
 *
 * <li>Or once every 2475 years or so (see {@link #duration()} ).</li></ul>
 *
 * <p>Note that the {@link Mfds} class includes useful static utilities for
 * working with Poisson probabilities, rates, and time spans.
