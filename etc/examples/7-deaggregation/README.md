Example 7: Deaggregation
------------------------

__Working directory:__ `/path/to/nshmp-haz/etc/examples/7-deaggregation`

To perform a deaggregation of hazard, one must use the program `DeaggCalc`. Internally, `DeaggCalc` calls `HazardCalc` and then reprocesses the data to generate a comma-delimited file of distance, magnitude, and epsilon bins, and a text file of summary statistics and primary contributing sources. For this, it can be helpful to create a second system alias:

```Shell
alias deagg='java -Xms1g -Xmx4g -cp /path/to/nshmp-haz/build/libs/nshmp-haz.jar gov.usgs.earthquake.nshmp.DeaggCalc'
```

`DeaggCalc` is similar to `HazardCalc` in every way except that the return-period of interest must be specified. For example, execute:

```Shell
deagg ../../../../nshm-cous-2008/Western\ US sites.geojson 2475 config.json
```

The results of the deaggregation are saved to a `deagg` directory along with hazard curves. As with `HazardCalc`, if `GMM` has been specified (as it has in the [config](https://github.com/usgs/nshmp-haz/blob/master/etc/examples/7-deaggregation/config.json) file for this example) additional deaggregation results for each GMM are generated as well.

See the following pages for more information on [deaggregation](https://github.com/usgs/nshmp-haz/wiki/about-deaggregation) and the meaning of [epsilon](https://github.com/usgs/nshmp-haz/wiki/what-is-epsilon).
