See the [examples](/usgs/nshmp-haz/tree/master/etc/examples) directory as a starting point for command-line use of nshmp-haz.

[Matlab](/usgs/nshmp-haz/tree/master/etc/matlab) shows how to take advantage of the ground motion model implementations in nshmp-haz.

[Peer](/usgs/nshmp-haz/tree/master/etc/peer) is a collection of simple source models that are also a good starting point.
