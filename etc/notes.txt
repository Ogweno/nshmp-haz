Differences from NSHMP
CH=SINGLE
SINGLE and GR are not logic tree branch choices, they are types of MFD's.

WRT suppression of epistemic uncertainty on GR branches when M-epi <6.5, we look to see if  SINGLE and 'floats' and M-epi < 6.5 (e.g. upper yellowstone) and turn uncertainty off. Larger M will be instances where fault is simply larger than char/single mag can reasonably fill. we also check GR MFDs (e.g. sheridan)

aleaCut in MagUncertainty not used

Revisit brange.3dip.gr.xml which throws warning and losers eli branch has no mags, but does not qualify for m<6.5 suppression of all epistemic uncertainty
dMag = 0.14
mMin = 6.5  --> 6.57  (min bin center)
mMax = 6.78 --> 6.71  (max bin center)

mMax - 0.2 = 6.51
